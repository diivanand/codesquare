BUILD/MODIFICATION INFO [OMI]
-----------------------------
The Front-End Code can be found in CodeSquareApp although if you plan on modifying 
the code and want to see your changes, you should first ask a Jive Web Master to 
give you access to the CodeSquare Repo on JiveApps and then you should clone the 
repo in a seperate folder outside this git folder using the `jiveapps clone codesquare` 
terminal command. It is also recommended that you read all the documentation found
in developers.jivesoftware.com if you plan on making permanent changes to the app.

The Back-End Code can be found in the CodeSquareJava folder, although a config 
folder has been omitted from this repo in this repo to prevent the knowledge of
private Jive URLs and other sensitive company-specific infrastructure data.

Needless to say, MapReduce Code used in our app can be found in the MapReduce
folder but I'm saying this just in case it wasn't clear.

Both the CodeSquare Back-End Code and the MapReduces each have their own build.xml
and two scripts exists in each folder to automatically build these two projects 
those scripts are run autumatically when someone pushes to this Repository. The scripts
also send the binary created from the build to their appropriate locations for deployment
THEREFORE IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR CODE IS BATTLETESTED BEFORE PUSHING 
TO THE REPO.
